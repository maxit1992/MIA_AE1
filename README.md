# TP1

## Description

In this TP, students are required to solve a problem using any of the algorithms studied in class, more details on 
[document](docs/uba-mia-ae1-dp.pdf). In my solution, I've solved a map journey with noisy data problem using PSO. 
A [report](docs/TP1_AE1_Maximiliano_Torti.pdf) with the analysis and conclusions of the work done is available.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Lab
